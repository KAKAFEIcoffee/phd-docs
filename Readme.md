# Log signature calculations

We have a python package, called *iisignature*, available on PyPI, which implements signature and log signature calculations reasonably efficiently. User documentation is in [iisignature.pdf]. The source code is [here](github.com/bottler/iisignature). The package is explained in [this paper on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08252). Some simple ideas used in the implementation of the signature parts are explained in [iisignature_tricks.pdf].

/Calculation of Iterated-Integral Signatures and Log Signatures/ in [logsignatures.pdf] explains enough algebra in explicit detail to understand what the Log Signature is. On [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02757). original code in [logsignature.zip]. demonstration at https://github.com/bottler/LogSignatureDemo. September 2016 presentation is [here](2016_crism_sep_computation_of_signatures.pdf).
